# Web Archives for Social Sciences Datathon - Team 1

> This is a cache of web data containing all commercial websites (.co.uk, landing webpages only) archived by the Common Crawl (2021) that (1) include at least one UK postcode in their web text, and (2) we believe represent Financial Services. Identify the different sub-classes (industries) within Financial Services and highlight the websites that provide Fintech services.

This github page features some of the code we wrote during the datathon and the results we presented. As the outputs of a hackathon the code here is piecemeal and hacky, please feel free to use as you wish, but not guarantees on it working or its usefulness! (All code CC-BY)
