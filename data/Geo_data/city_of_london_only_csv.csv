“undertaking a survey of nearly 160 advisers was a daunting task for us. we didn’t know where to begin, or what questions to ask, and partners never seemed to follow through when we had undertaken this sort of the thing in the past. heather and nextwealth did everything – with almost no time or effort for us. the best part was that i could completely trust them to produce a comprehensive set of meaningful results. their format provides us with the confidence to implement new techniques immediately, with real insight into where we are as a business and where we need to focus our efforts going forward.”

london, uk
a finextra event
the ai revolution in banking
nextgen banking: the ai revolution is returning to london for a one-day event bringing together industry leaders in digital banking, payments and innovation to explore how this new era of disruption will permeate and reshape financial services.
ai has already started to shake up traditional banking models, but what role will the technology play in the future of finance? join us on 16th may 2019 to hear experts debate these topics, align banking strategies and network with peers and colleagues.

2019 agenda
there is no doubt that ai is the next wave of computing and will unleash major change in all industries. but what does the rise of ai mean for the next generation of banking?
for financial institutions, ai represents an opportunity to radically improve efficiency, risk management and regulatory compliance, and customer service.
but to stay ahead of the ai revolution, financial institutions need to navigate a complex array of ai techniques, cultural challenges and technology decisions, to ensure they lay solid foundations for their ai-driven futures.
finextra’s nextgen banking london 2019 conference on 16 may will bring together practitioners from across the financial services industry to explore what the ai revolution means for banks – and what financial institutions need to do in the short, medium and longer terms to benefit from ai, and ensure their customers do so as well.
the conference programme will tackle a number of important questions including:
what do we mean by ai? it’s a broad church. what are the key ai techniques financial institutions are - or should be - exploring?
in which business and application areas within financial services does ai have the most potential now and in the future?
what are the technology and cultural considerations banks must address to move forward with ai?
whether your business is in retail or commercial banking or capital markets, and whether your focus is front or back office, the ai revolution means change.
join us at nextgen banking london 2019 to gain actionable insights into how to profit from that change by leveraging ai and the benefits it can bring.

bringing it all together
founded in 2008, cormorant partnership began after being approached by a small group of clients who were looking for a solution to the difficulties of managing their wealth in a constantly moving and ever-changing financial climate.
these clients expressed a desire to have one trusted adviser with expertise to oversee and co-ordinate their financial affairs along with the objective to increase and protect family wealth.
we adamantly believe that honesty, trust and integrity are fundamental to a successful and productive partnership between client and adviser.
these virtues, together with experienced technical advice and liaising with other professionals to achieve the clients' goals, define our unique and comprehensive service.

sustainability is front and centre in how we develop portfolios. ten years ago it was difficult to access sustainable funds across different asset classes. now it is ubiquitous amongst fund managers, which brings new challenges in terms of research and selection.

through this portal, landlords can now receive swift, bespoke & independent tax structure advice directly from our professional provider panel, led by a uk top 100 firm of chartered accountants; with 17 partners and 125 staff, 3 uk locations (providing nationwide coverage), established for more than 70 years.
with the raft of incoming tax and relief changes now impacting every landlord, it is essential to now seek professional tax advice. it is also essential that financial brokers or intermediaries do not inadvertently (or otherwise) give landlord clients tax advice when not qualified to do so.
a professional tax adviser will be able to guide a landlord as to the most efficient tax structure for their personal circumstances going forwards – as either a private individual, as a partnership or as a limited company.
using this lss service, landlords can quickly receive an individually-tailored, professional and indemnified opinion regarding the optimum tax structure in which to hold their new (or existing) btl properties, by completing this tax advice questionnaire.
based on the information provided in the questionnaire, and any follow-up conversations, the tax adviser will be able to construct and provide their formal, written advice.

summary of the options for their existing buy to let portfolio, with the related specific tax consequences if they left the properties in their personal names, or if they transferred them to a limited company
summary of the tax consequences, based on the client’s individual circumstances, for any future buy to let purchases, and if they should be purchased personally, or through a limited company.
formal conclusion/recommendation, based on the client’s individual circumstances, of how they should be best structuring the ownership of their investment property/s going forward to achieve maximum tax efficiency.

once the letter is received, decisions can be made regarding the most appropriate btl finance options, based on the professional tax advice received.
the entire process – from submission of the online questionnaire, to receipt of the written advice – can be achieved in 3 business days (or less), provided all information is provided when requested.
for this exclusive service, there is a fixed charge of £300+vat – payable by the landlord, directly to the accountants.

inspire list
the inspire list promotes the wide range of people already giving their time, skills and experiences for the benefit of charitable organisations.
this is the first initiative of the trustee diversity panel, which is supported by trustees unlimited.
we know that trustee boards aren’t diverse enough and one of the challenges is people from a wide range of backgrounds who are unable to see people like them represented as trustees.
however, as that picture slowly changes, our aim is to gather the profiles of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who are already serving on boards.

about rowena griffiths
i have over 20 years experience in financial services, as an adviser and in management. i advise mainly on pensions and investments and a typical client would be someone planning for retirement or in retirement. i also help clients manage their investments, protect their families and mitigate against inheritance tax. i help people understand the complexities of financial products. i am a holistic financial planner, which involves first identifying a client’s financial goals and writing a plan based on their aims and to address any shortfalls.
although i don’t exclusively advise women, i do receive a lot of enquiries on divorce. also, ethical investments are becoming more and more popular.
i started advising clients in 1991 when i was working for a major high street bank. however, my first introduction to holistic financial planning was in 1994 when i joined a small division of prudential called private financial planning services. i was able to study hard and gained my advanced financial planning certificate, now known as ‘diploma status.’ this was one of the most enjoyable jobs i have held, as prudential has a strong brand and some excellent products. the main offering, however, was a financial planning service which reflected the clients’ goals and needs, rather than a recommendation of products to invest in.
in 2001 i was made redundant and decided to take a year off to travel the world. on my return, i was able to realise a longstanding ambition and become an independent financial adviser. i joined a company called sedgewicks, but left when they were taken over by barclays bank and lost their independent status. i have been with my present company for the last 8 years, offering the same independent advice, although the name above the door has changed a few times over the years!
i have been told by my clients that i add the most value by making complex and possibly daunting financial products understandable. i offer an initial meeting without cost or obligation.

what our customers have to tell you
i can highly recommend blackwell global. i have traded with a number of brokers, and blackwells stp model along with excellent customer service has been the best broker i have found yet. they were even able to accommodate me with a lower leverage to lower my risk :) (trust me it easy to find a broker who will increase your leverage) blackwell went the extra mile to accommodate my conservative risk profile.
top quality broker!
more than 8 months trading, have no problem, fast withdrawing profit to my bank account (it's about 1-2 days). brillant relationship managers, very honest, helpful support. very fast execution, very good services.
if you want a serious broker with serious regulation and the best safety of funds this is the spot.
opening of my account and upgrade to professional status went fast and smoothly. customer support is professional and helpful. execution and spread are excellent. i like the fact that blackwell is regulated broker.

about the group
lighthouse is part of the quilter plc and is a diverse group of financial advisory firms, providing financial solutions tailored to meet clients’ needs, be they individual or corporate. we operate a business model which allows advisers and firms to select whether they want to offer independent or restricted advice and be supported accordingly.
whilst lighthouse have these solutions for all types of individuals and businesses; most of our financial planning will be provided by our restricted national side of the business – lighthouse financial advice. our initial complimentary consultations for consumers that request to be contacted will be managed by our client services team in woodingdean, and passed to a financial adviser in the local area. this allows us to serve our growing number of clients in the most efficient way and enables us to refer those who require more specialised independent advice, onto our network business.
how we are maintaining our advice service
we want to reassure you that we are committed to providing the best possible service to you during the outbreak of coronavirus.
while we have closed our offices until further notice, and have moved to full remote working, we are still very much ‘open for business’, although we will not be conducting face to face meetings.
we have strong business continuity processes in place, to ensure we are able to effectively service and support our clients at all times. and we also have the reassurance that comes from knowing we benefit from the support, expertise, and financial security of being part of quilter – a leading provider of advice, investments, and wealth management both in the uk and internationally.
we have taken immediate steps to ensure we can continue to support your needs, including:
all staff working from remote locations as necessary, using our secure and tested technology
making greater use of video conferencing tools to keep in contact with clients, colleagues and advisers
no business travel
office phone lines are being diverted so you can still get in touch
supporting colleagues to remain resilient through periods of altered working practices
as the situation continues to evolve we will keep adapting to the needs of our colleagues and you, our much valued clients.
if you have any questions or concerns regarding your investments please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

financial planning
professional financial planning is the process which aims to help you realise your ambitions - whatever they may be. as professional financial advisers we can help you make informed decisions about your financial future, in the short, medium and long term. you will almost certainly have goals of one kind or another - buying a home, starting a family, living abroad, perhaps retiring, but these have financial implications and leaving it to chance isn't an option. careful planning helps to turn you

there are events we can all face that have the potential to wreck lives and families. it’s a difficult issue to think about, but imagine the impact on you and your family should the main earner in your household die or become seriously ill. it may not happen to you – we hope it doesn’t – but it might. while there is no insurance that can prevent these things from happening, you can protect yourself and your family financially by making money available, should something unexpected happen.

savings & investments
often, people save for a specific reason and it's usually the safest way to build up a pot of money. it’s less risky than investing, but it offers limited growth. the most you'll earn on the money you save is the interest added. saving is perfect for people who don’t want to take any risks with their money, and most savings accounts have easy access or are for a fixed term.

every business needs to protect itself. for most businesses the most valuable asset it has is its people. without them, a company’s survival could be at serious risk. with that in mind we can help you take the right steps to protect your people and your business. after all, you already protect many of the important things that keep your business running smoothly, like property, fleets and stock. so you should also insure your most valuable assets: your staff and shareholders.

mortgages
mortgages are loans which are intended to help buyers purchase residential property. when you take out a loan, the lender charges interest: the same is true of a mortgage. a mortgage is a ‘secured’ loan, which means that the loan is secured against the property being purchased until the mortgage is paid off. sources of residential mortgages include high street banks, building societies and other types of less well known financial institutions.

pensions
when you retire you still need food and shelter as an absolute minimum, but of course you will want to maintain the lifestyle to which you have become accustomed, so unless you can guarantee a large inheritance or windfall, then you need to provide yourself with a secure income for the rest of your life. a well prepared pension plan which is regularly reviewed should go some way to providing you with a reasonable level of income in your retirement.

wealth management
wealth, just like your health, must be carefully preserved. your assets need to be protected against the potential threats of erosion by taxation, the effects of inflation and investment risks. whatever your level of wealth, there is nothing wrong in making the decision to prepare a risk aversion strategy. risk aversion is a reasonable and prudent strategy for anyone who is sure that they already have ample assets to provide for themselves and their family into the future.

taxation
most of us face being taxed on our income, our capital gains, and in some circumstances the value of our estate when we die. taxation can be very complicated and the rules, reliefs and allowances often change, so it is worth obtaining a clear grasp of how these taxes work by discussing with a professional adviser the most efficient way to arrange your finances.

i have known peter for many years and always found him enthusiastic, easy to deal with and very helpful. he has always helped me be more tax efficient than i would have been if i had tried to manage my wealth on my own. my wife and i recently had our first child and so peter also then helped us get in place some life and critical illness insurance to ensure that we would be left in a good financial position if anything were to happen to our health. peter then introduced us to freddie who helped us lock in a much better mortgage with great flexibility as we are looking to move to a new family home but had some delays.

i met with frederick from fortis because i wanted to explore the options for investing a lump sum. the first meeting we had was very thorough where frederick gained an understanding of my attitude to risk, this enabled him to find the right products for me to consider for investment. the reports that were produced were complicated to say the least but frederick and his team were on hand to explain these to me, so they made sense to me and i felt comfortable with proceeding to make an investment. i took my time to make decisions and at no time was i rushed or asked where i was in my decision.

lloydsbank.co.uk traceroute
traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route (path) and measuring transit delays of packets across an internet protocol (ip) network. the history of the route is recorded as the round-trip times of the packets received from each successive host (remote node) in the route (path); the sum of the mean times in each hop is a measure of the total time spent to establish the connection. traceroute proceeds unless all (three) sent packets are lost more than twice, then the connection is lost and the route cannot be evaluated.

//////////
financial crime compliance is now a critical element of any firm’s operating model, driving the right culture and ways of working to protect individuals and organisations from fraud, money laundering, reputational damage and regulatory sanctions.
with the exponential increase in financial crime threats and regulatory requirements, it is essential that firms have the appropriate infrastructure in place to both counteract and respond to incidents or regulatory oversight.
skott consulting specialises in supporting clients to develop and implement cost effective risk based and proportionate, yet comprehensive control frameworks, remediating existing deficiencies, responding to incidents or deploying integrated financial crime projects across the firm. additionally, it can provide assurance assessments, training or other financial crime support as required.
skott consulting supports clients by working together to fully understand the firm’s risks and operating environment to meet their needs, whether as a stand-alone assignment, interim leadership or to supplement the firm’s existing capability.

faq's
how do i work most compliantly as a contractor with ir35 in mind?
the landscape for ir35 is constantly changing and with the introduction of ir35 into the public sector beginning in 2020, contractors must begin to prepare themselves. to begin you can visit our ir35 pages here which include our helpful videos on the matter
in addition, recent case law surrounding personal service companies shows that running a ltd company as a contractor is perhaps not the safe and compliant route it has typically been considered to be. to discuss the expected pitfalls and new legislation with a member of the team to ensure your future planning is compliant please contact us.
i’ve received a follower notice from hmrc and i don’t know what to do.
receiving a follower notice and apn is a shock for many. it may come out of the blue and indeed we have seen follower notices arrive after ten years of inaction by hmrc. dealing with the subsequent process does not need to be stressful and there are sometimes ways to challenge. you can find more information about challenging demands from hmrc here.
my client has an outstanding enquiry with hmrc, how much information should i give?
this will largely depend on the type of enquiry received. for example, if a s.9a has been received this is a more informal request for information and we can therefore be more selective about the questioning. conversely if a schedule 36 notice is received then failure to comply is met with penalties and so a fuller response is required to protect your client. it is recommended that you speak with one of our advisers who will be able to assist you further in drafting suitable responses and reviewing your drafts.
i want to challenge hmrc’s demands but don’t want to do it on my own.
depending on the demand you’ve received it is possible that wtt has already organised a group to defend hmrc’s assertion that tax is due. we currently manage groups of individuals defending tax demands from the following products, contractor loan arrangements, offshore tax structuring, film partnerships, enterprise investment schemes (eis), enterprise zones trusts (ezt’s), business premises renovation allowance schemes (bpra’s), property syndicates, share loss schemes, ebt’s and discounted security schemes.
it is therefore likely that wtt is already working with a group on your scheme and you should not fear challenging the demand alone. please contact us to find out more about our groups or find out more about challenging hmrc’s demands here.
my end client has given me a contract to sign that makes me liable if my ir35 status is challenged.
the continuous changes that we’re seeing in the ir35 arena is causing confusion for all parties which is leading to ill-drafted contracts seeking to protect positions which are not appropriate. wtt legal’s expert team spend significant time on contract negotiations between contractors and end-clients. for a no-obligation review of your contract please contact our legal team.
my scheme operator has demanded i repay a loan from years ago. what can i do?
it is becoming more and more common that trustees and scheme operators are recalling loans received many years ago in an effort to legitimise the schemes they marketed following new legislation and precedent. these demands can be terrifying, but commonly lack substance and can be defended easily. wtt has successfully defended a number of these demands to date and we are confident that we have arguments for the vast majority of contractor loan arrangements.
please contact us immediately if you receive a demand of this nature.
i’m unsure of my liability if i settle with hmrc, how do i work this out?
wtt offers potential clients a no-obligation review of their position which includes a free calculation of potential liability. to take up this opportunity please contact the team.

important announcements
persia international bank plc, is acutely aware of the ever increasing spread of the coronavirus (covid 19) and the dangers this presents to both its staff and customers, whose personal health and safety is our paramount priority. as a consequence the bank is taking the following measures:
preparations are being made for key staff to work remotely, as well as accessing their e. mails , thus enabling transactions to be effected and queries responded to
maintaining only a skeleton staff within the bank’s building and varying their working hours in an endeavour to mitigate the risk of spreading the disease.

experts in business, not just accounting
helping you maximise profits and minimise inefficiencies
- annual business reviews as standard
-	no unexpected fees; fixed monthly billing
-	specialist advice whenever you need it
the new age of accounting
your finances at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere
-	cloud accounting gives you access to your finances 24/7
-	outsource your operations to us, we'll ensure things run smoothly
-	move your business in the right direction, we focus on the future
specialists in all things tax
we're much more than just tax returns
-	structure your business to increase profits and improve cash flow
-	make your business more attractive to investors through eis/seis
-	here to assist and file your vat and corporation tax returns
r&d claims, budgets, forecasts and business plans
as well as understanding how the business has performed historically, it’s crucial to appreciate where you are heading. we can map out what the next few years are going to look like and work together to smash every target. perhaps more importantly, we’ll help you to truly understand your cash flow and identify future shortfalls. as the old adage goes, cash is king!
find out more
taxation advisory services
taxation is a key yet daunting area for any small business. one wrong step can lead to headaches, lost reliefs and worst of all, phonecalls with hmrc. with leap in your corner, all this goes away. we’ll ensure you maximise reliefs and minimise the dreaded tax bill. we’ll also ensure everything is filed in a timely manner.
find out more
statutory and management accounting
the financials of any business tell a story but all too often no-one gets to hear it. our management accounts will provide a better understanding of what is driving your profits and maybe whats slowing it down. armed with this, you can focus on growing the business while we get your statutory accounts filed.
find out more
operations & processes
from bookkeeping and expense management to payroll and invoicing, leap provides the key processes to ensure your business runs smoothly and efficiently. time is perhaps the most underrated resource of any small business. leap will bring it to you by the bucket load.
find out more
business development & corporate finance
running a business is a journey from start-up to exit and we want to join you. we’ll be available at every step to advise and guide you on the key choices that will impact the future of your business. from raising new finance to selling your business, we know our stuff.
find out more
the cloud is the future
time is perhaps the most valuable resource of any sme and it should not be wasted. hours spent processing transactions are hours not spent focused on the strategy of your business. cloud accounting software minimises manual tasks and provides valuable insight to understand the past and make better decisions for the future.
no two businesses are the same and cloud-based solutions recognise this. through the integration of third-party apps, we can help you design a finance function to provide the services you need and avoid paying for the ones you don’t. debtors slow to pay? we have an app to help. want to better understand what’s driving your sales? there’s an app for that too.
the world is digitalising and your business shouldn’t be any different. ditch your archaic system and join the cloud today.
why us?
at leap accounts & outsourcing, we believe the days of the old-fashioned accountant are over. no more should your accountant turn up once a year to hand you a set of accounts for signing and an invoice for paying. in today’s modern age, an accountant should be pro-active and forward looking, helping you to identify areas in which your business can perform better.
leap is not an old-fashioned accountant. we don’t just want to help you meet deadlines… we want to work with you to help your business grow.
an all too common complaint from small business’s is that they only hear from their accountant when a deadline is looming. not us. we provide a business health-check every six months for all clients to review how the business is performing and how we can help it improve. and if an unexpected tax issue arises or you’re thinking about raising some cash to expand? we are always available to lend an ear and offer practical, effective solutions. we believe clients should pay for the value we provide, not for how long we spend on the phone to you.
request a call back
would you like to speak to one of our advisers over the phone? just submit your details and we’ll be in touch shortly. you can also email us if you would prefer.
do you have questions about how leap can help your company? send us an email and we’ll get in touch shortly, or phone us on 020 3290 7302 — we would be delighted to speak to you.

this area needs serious leadership, smart decision making, accurate predictive horizon scanning, and ultimately exceptional talent. it also needs pragmatic organisational design and a way to wire ‘reputation’ and trust into the organisation’s operating practices.

enabling transformational growth through targeted acquisition
we are the specialists in providing clients with transformational growth opportunities within the global insurance and reinsurance markets. giving unparalleled access to potential new revenue streams, we support you in the execution of your strategic development plans.
we have been involved in some of the most high-profile market moves of recent years, and have a proven track record of delivering solutions discreetly and efficiently by way of:
the introduction of high-performing producers and business leaders
the transitioning of market-leading specialty teams and business units
the origination of m&a opportunities across niche and specialty lines
search
in a world where capital is available to all, claims are outsourced and it systems interchangeable, the key to growth is offering something different. make talent your differentiator and your people become your assets.
our research led methodology and unparalleled market interaction enable us to give incisive, exclusive access to the leading production-focused talent across the sector.
teams
even the best individual talent can only effect a finite amount of new client opportunities. acquiring a “group of individuals” can deliver transformative growth and should be considered as a more surgical approach to your m&a activity.
we have proven experience of delivering legally complex group opportunities, and have successfully transitioned numerous teams and business units with no legal recourse.
m&a
in an environment where technology is driving change at an unprecedented rate, business leaders have a rapidly diminishing window of opportunity to innovate and transform. when considering whether to build or buy, understand that acquisition can be the most effective way to achieve this evolution.
our network is extensive and our deal origination ability unrivalled in this space, make us a key part of your m&a strategy.

warning to shareholders
we are aware that some shareholders may have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. these are typically from overseas based organisations who target uk shareholders offering to sell them, what often turn out to be, worthless or high risk shares in us or uk investments. they can be extremely persistent and persuasive. shareholders are therefore advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice or offers.
please note that it is most unlikely that either the company or the company’s registrar, link asset services, would make unsolicited telephone calls to shareholders. any such calls would only ever relate to official documentation already circulated to shareholders and never in respect of investment ‘advice’.
if you are in any doubt about the veracity of an unsolicited telephone call, please call the company secretary +44 (0)800 389 4696 or the registrar on +44 (0) 371 664 0300.
you can also report and get advice about fraud or cyber crime by contacting action fraud – national fraud & cyber crime reporting centre 0300 123 2040 and visiting their website at www.actionfraud.police.uk.
welcome to the brunner investment trust
seeking out the best opportunities for growth and reliable dividends wherever they may be, the brunner investment trust invests in companies all over the world. brunner aims to provide investors with growth in capital and dividends over the long term. we measure the trust’s performance against the benchmark index (70% ftse world ex-uk index and 30% ftse all-share index).
share price is the price of a single ordinary share, as determined by the stock market. the share price above is the mid-market price at market close.
share price
1100.0p
net asset value (nav) per share is calculated as available shareholders’ funds divided by the number of shares in issue, with shareholders’ funds taken to be the net value of all the company’s assets after deducting liabilities. the nav figure above is based on the fair/market value of the company’s long-term debt and preference shares (known as debt at market value). this allows for the valuation of long-term debt and preference shares at fair value or current market price, rather than at final repayment value (known as debt at par).
nav per share
1198.2p
premium/discount. since investment company shares are traded on a stock market, the share price that you get may be higher or lower than the nav. the difference is known as a premium or discount.

-8.2%
dividend yield is calculated using the latest full year dividend divided by the current share price.

why use bank transaction data
predictive behavioural data

actionable insights

a little bit about us	
cavendish ware began life in 2003.
we formed the firm out of a frustration with the way many of the large, established brands in the uk, trading under the banner of ‘private banks’ and ‘wealth managers’, provided financial advice.
their increasing internal focus, lack of client service and continual move to a more highly commoditised, transaction, almost conveyor belt approach meant that we felt the time was right for us to set up a smaller, boutique firm that was able to provide more bespoke advice.
learn more
we want to thank you for your constant support and excellent advice in dealing with our pensions and investments. whether one is busy running a business or happily retired (and even more busy, strangely enough!), one’s own affairs usually feature well down any “to do list”. so, it is invaluable to be able to utterly trust and rely on the expertise of cavendish ware, which has proved itself many times over with sound advice and sympathetic, patient support. we don’t know where we’d be without you all!
ray & annie long (retired, former owners of long travel)
like many, i’ve been investing in my pension for many years. it felt like the money was going into a black hole with little real feedback. apart from an annual statement of contributions and portfolio value along with a summary meeting with your ifa, i had little idea on how or if my pension was going to meet my retirement needs. i was introduced to jack as my advisor. i have not looked back since. what makes him stand out for me is the access to information and the willingness to support and advise. he uses cash flow modelling software which modelled my personal financial circumstances and apply different scenarios allowing me to understand, almost instantly all the variables that affect me and my ongoing needs. this allied to cavendish ware’s new client portal gives me high levels of confidence and insight. as a layman this has been a real eyeopener, and allowed me to plan for the future with far more clarity and reassurance then i could have ever expected. we all understand the vagaries of investing in the market, but purely on a level of service and support i cannot recommend jack and cavendish ware highly enough.
neale williams, managing director, surfdev
it's great having jack in our corner, helping us arrive at the right choices. it's definitely made us feel more in control and better informed, and thus to be in a position to talk about our plans, both short and long term.

notice to creditors and suppliers - icl to enter a solvent members' voluntary liquidation (mvl)
update 26th march 2020
on 9 october 2019, the high court approved scheme of arrangement between icl and its creditors became effective. you can find the scheme supervisors' first quarterly report to creditors here
as part of the scheme process, any scheme creditor’s claim against icl must be submitted on or before the deadline of 9 april 2020 if it is to be considered for a potential dividend payment. we explain how you can do this in our faqs
even before the scheme was approved, we had already ceased making new high-cost short-term loans and closed our stores. we had always envisaged that after creditors submitted their claims, and once accepted claims received payment in accordance with the terms of the scheme, icl would shut down. as part of this process, icl will be placed into a solvent members' voluntary liquidation (mvl) on 30 march 2020.
the mvl will not affect the operation of the scheme. the scheme will continue to be implemented by icl under the control of its directors.
the mvl will not affect your ability as a scheme creditor to submit a claim. if you have not already done so, we invite you to submit your claim on or before 9 april 2020. claims received after that date will not be accepted and you will not receive any payment from icl.
the mvl will not affect suppliers who were excluded creditors under the terms of the scheme or who have provided goods and services from 9 october 2019 onwards and who continue to do so. your invoices will continue to be paid in full and on the agreed terms by icl.
information for landlords and rating authorities
as part of the liquidation, it is envisaged that, pursuant to section 178 of the insolvency act 1986, the liquidators of icl will, immediately after their appointment, disclaim leases of properties which are empty, or have not been transferred to a third party:
if you are a landlord, this means that your premises will be returned to you. as explained in the guidance we sent to you along with your claim form, you are able to submit a claim in the scheme for the amount to which you would have been entitled if icl had gone into liquidation on 9 october 2019 and the liquidator had immediately disclaimed the lease.
if you are a rating authority, this means that any questions relating to liability for non-domestic rates from 1 april 2020 should be addressed to the landlord of the relevant premises.
for further information, or for assistance in submitting your claim in the scheme, please do not hesitate to contact us at scheme@themoneyshop.co.uk or call our helpline on 020 3901 7440 (monday – friday, 9am – 5pm).
instant cash loans limited is now in a scheme of arrangement.
update 9th june 2021 - the june 2021 quarterly update to creditors report is now available. please click on the scheme documents button below and then click on the quarterly report link to review the report. this contains updated information regarding the progress of the scheme.
what this means?
icl and its creditors are bound by a scheme of arrangement, which came into effect on 9th october 2019.
the scheme ran up until the deadline of 9th april 2020 when all claims were required to be submitted in our customer claims portal. any claims submitted after midnight on 10th april 2020 will not be processed as a valid claim.
icl have started to release customer outcomes but will not be making any payments until after all claims in the scheme have been assessed. we will instead determine how much the scheme can pay out on each claim received by reviewing the total amount of redress offered.

what our clients say about us:
the other providers promised all of the basics that i needed but wei leng understood the needs of my business beyond the basic monthly figures....headstart financials was able to offer a great understanding of my business. i feel like we have more of a business partnering arrangement rather than being handed a set of figures and left to my own devices.
robert m.

wei leng is knowledgeable with great attention to detail. she went far above and beyond the role, understanding and helping to work through bigger picture issues, rather than narrow focus on the tasks at hand. she has been very responsive and would highly recommend her services to any small businesses.

about academies finance
academies finance
academies finance is a specialist education finance consultancy providing custom and managed finance function solutions to academies and multi academy trusts since the beginning of the academy program.
​
we also provide qualified, high quality and professional finance directors, bookkeepers and finance staff to schools and academies.
our focus is to ensure you comply with the academies financial handbook, save you time and provide you value for money.
​
academies finance's mission is to help equip every academy trust and school with a qualified and robust finance team, regardless of its size. we work with academy trusts to recruit finance professionals. from bookkeeper to chief financial officers, we seek out the best talent with a passion for taking on challenging and rewarding roles in the education sector. unlike local authority maintained schools, academies are responsible for managing their own finances; which are open to public scrutiny. we look to provide trusts and schools with the resources they need to build up capable finance teams that have a broad spectrum of skills and experience and a sound knowledge of the academies financial handbook. we can provide strategic advice on the optimal finance structure for an academy, dealing with an educations funding audit (efa) or business recovery situation. we can also provide training to both finance and non-finance staff on the latest developments in academy finance.

*esg integrated definition: our top-down focus on responsible investment has driven us to develop a proprietary esg scoring system. we closely monitor any low-scoring investment holdings that might signal worrying tail risks. our goal is to address the esg themes that are most significant for investors so that we can protect client returns into the future. our screening policy applies across the vast majority of assets. this excludes manufacturers of controversial weapons and companies who derive more than 30% of revenues from coal production. we also exclude assets linked to food commodities or palm oil production. esg integrated funds apply additional screening to exclude tobacco producers and companies in violation of the un global compact. we seek to minimise exposure to companies with low esg scores, however there is no systematic objective to reduce the investment universe further at this level. esg research and key performance indicators (kpis) form part of the investment decision-making process in portfolios. on average, about 4-5% of a benchmark index would be excluded from investments at this level. all esg integrated funds are subject to our stewardship approach. percentages may not equal 100% due to rounding. all data as of 30/06/2020.

we have always found rob [young] to be very approachable and knowledgeable. we have every confidence in the advice given and feel comfortable with the decisions we’ve made. there are certain opportunities that we wouldn’t have known about if rob hadn’t brought them to light, which makes the advice good value for money as far as we’re concerned.

what our clients say
have a look at our clients’ stories
""their financial expertise is exemplary but what makes the difference is their acute emotional intelligence.""
our relationship with capital has been less about finance and more to do with discussing and planning for the moments that, in the old days, would have featured in the family photo album. their financial expertise is exemplary but what makes the difference is their acute emotional intelligence.
harry and fiona macauslansenior executives, retired
london
we really loved capital’s holistic approach to financial planning.
not only have they done an amazing job putting our financial affairs in order and saving us lots in fees, but they have also reinvigorated our lives. we have a newfound passion for growth and change which would not have possible without their help. we really loved capital’s holistic approach to financial planning.

protection
the cost of insurance, particularly life insurance has fallen over recent years, whilst the quality of cover has in many cases increased.
mortgages
not only do you need to consider which mortgage is best for you, you also need to think about which interest rate options are most likely to suit your needs.
pension planning
here, we explain why pension planning is so important, and describe some of the options available to you.
investments
investing money needs careful consideration and you need to be absolutely sure of the risks involved.
business protection
business protection is all about insuring for the unexpected. it's a way of protecting your business if something goes wrong.
important notification
in light of the recent government announcements on covid 19 and ongoing guidance, we have put measures in place to protect our employees and to support the request to minimise the spread of the virus.
we have arranged for the majority of our employees to work remotely and are confident that they will be able to continue to provide the high levels of service that our business relies upon and that our clients expect.
during this time, we ask that you contact us by email, if possible, as this will enable our dedicated teams to respond to you as quickly as possible. please go to contact us to see individual email addresses.
your adviser continues to be contactable by telephone, in addition to email.

what our clients say
i have worked with the dowgate team (especially lorna, david, james and paul) for over three decades. their expertise, especially in small and medium cap companies made them the natural partner for us, as we developed our plans to build a new age/new era advertising and marketing services solution for the digital marketing communications industry. in 2018, the derriston shell provided the platform for s4 capital to list on the lse, having merged with mediamonks, with dowgate providing technical support throughout the process. they also introduced shareowners that have repeatedly provided growth capital to support our development, as we have grown to become a group with a well over £4b market capitalisation.
sir martin sorrell, founder & executive chairman of s4 capital
i have worked with members of the dowgate team for over three decades. their expertise in shell companies made them the natural partner for me as i developed my plans to build a modern platform for news publishing. we floated national world as a cash shell in september 2019 and, despite the disruption from the covid-19 pandemic, we completed the acquisition of jpi group in december 2020. we needed to move quickly to acquire the group, and the dowgate team facilitated this by using an innovative structure of convertible loan notes. we now have a shareholder base that has provided us with growth capital as we pursue further opportunities.
david montgomery, ceo of national world
i have worked with members of the dowgate team for over two decades. they advised on the ipo of franchise brands in 2016, introducing shareholders that have provided growth capital as we have significantly grown the business through acquisitions. in april 2020, dowgate helped us raise funding to navigate the covid-19 pandemic, which enabled us to support all of our stakeholders. with the pandemic behind us, we are now working with dowgate to deploy this capital as we accelerate our digital transformation, enabling us to deliver our medium-term financial targets.

who we are
dowgate wealth was formed with the belief that sustainable compound returns are best generated from bespoke investment portfolios. we also believe that no client is the same and we must deliver high levels of personalised and on time service. this is contrary to the overly centralised asset allocation approach which has enamoured the asset management industry over recent years. in a world which continues to change, our philosophy allows us to remain flexible to continuously meet our clients’ needs.
more about us
fund management
our approach and experience of investing over the long term provides the perfect foundation for institutional fund management. we discuss every investment case as a team as it is our fundamental belief that every member offers a unique insight. this creates an environment in which we continuously challenge our investment potential and also to mitigate downside risk. our speciality of investing in both small and large companies provides us with significant experience of the regulatory environment and managing liquidity requirements.

what our clients say
“i have worked with the new team at dowgate wealth for well over five years. i have complete confidence in the rigour of their analysis, their passion for making top-quality returns and their open-mindedness in adapting to changes in the market place. i could not be more impressed about the ease of joining the new firm, which denotes to me their desire to put the client first and foremost.”
plc chairman & pe investor
""i transferred my portfolio to dowgate from another major wealth manager in order to take advantage of their far more focussed and individual approach. i look for the support of professionals who properly understand my personal investment aims and then build and actively manage a tailored portfolio of well researched assets. i have known some of the dowgate team for a number of years and particularly value their exemplary knowledge of the markets they operate within and their enthusiasm and judgement in exploring new opportunities. it is essential to have a wealth management team i can trust who are always contactable, responsive and candid.""
private investor
""my decision to move from my previous “provider” has been shown to be a very positive one helped by the freshness and efficient approach and service level from dowgate plus access to a very informative and regularly updated personal client asset and trading information site.”
private investor
""jeremy has looked after my personal portfolio and that of my company’s pension fund for many years now. he presently has a significant portfolio invested on my behalf. he has served me well. on the strength of his advice and performance, i have successfully introduced him to friends and business colleagues. it is a pleasure to work with him - he listens to what his clients have to say, and yet he is not afraid to discourage investments, which he considers to be doubtful. that said, he always respects our wishes. when i found out that he was joining dowgate, it was a no-brainer that i should follow him there with my portfolios, and i look forward to more of the same...best of all he, loves cricket!""
private investor
over the last 10 years ben mckeown has managed a substantial amount of my family’s wealth. i have followed ben to dowgate from 2 previous wealth firms. trust is a big part of any wealth management relationship, and ben and his team definitely have mine. ben is an extremely passionate economist who enjoys investigating companies to try and find quality value and stand out opportunity. the financial performance over the years of our relationship has been very impressive delivering returns over and above any comparable benchmarks. the fund managers role in my eyes is to make sure that the portfolio is well balanced, risk is managed as high priority and my families wealth is preserved for generations to come. ben ticks all the boxes in that regards. we look forward to a long and healthy relationship with ben and the team at dowgate.

embark property is part of the embark group, a fast growing, diversified, financial services business and one of the largest retirement solutions providers in the uk. it provides property services to the following companies within the group:
embark pensions – full sipp
rowanmoor ssas
rowanmoor – family pension trust
the team also provide property services to the existing back book of customers of rowanmoor sipp and solo ssas, ebs sipp, sappp and ssas and hornbuckle sipp, flexible income pension plan and ssas.
this website provides information about the property services we provide through our group companies. please note it is primarily for use by advisers and customers in conjunction with their adviser. the information and opinions provided are for guidance only and are not intended as investment advice. we recommend that you seek advice from a recognised investment professional before making any decision to invest in property or one of our products.
buying commercial property via a pension can be a tax-efficient way to inject cash into a business and provide regular income for the scheme in the form of rent. it is also possible for the pension to borrow up to 50% of the net value of the scheme to assist with the purchase provided the rent is sufficient to cover loan repayments.
our property team has over twenty years experience in buying, administering, and selling commercial properties in pension plans to ensure transactions are carried out in accordance with pension regulations and minimise any associated risks. whilst the pension rules for investing can seem complex, embark property are here to assist you and your adviser through the process.
investing in commercial property
how we work
investing in commercial property can be complex and time consuming. our aim for each transaction is to make the process as straightforward and efficient as possible, and we take over the end to end process and deal with all parties so that you don’t have to.
we prefer to work with our panel solicitors who have extensive knowledge of transactions within pensions and know the way we and hmrc work. we have pre-agreed reports and lease documentation in place to simplify the conveyancing process and have negotiated a schedule of fees for each type of transaction. you may still use a solicitor of your choice but this involves more work for us and we reserve the right to charge higher fees.
we will review any proposals to establish whether they are pension compliant and where possible, to avoid incurring unnecessary fees if a transaction cannot go ahead.
we also have an experienced vat team who will a deal with any vat registrations and vat returns required.
something to keep in mind
commercial property can be a less liquid investment and disposal of it may take longer than exchange traded investments. you should take this into account when considering a property investment and the need for liquid assets to pay retirement benefits as and when they fall due or additionally, during times when a property is unlet as insurance and business rates will still be payable.
why us
dedicated, experienced property and vat team
well versed in the intricacies of holding property within a pension scheme
we oversee a portfolio of c6,000 uk properties
we specialise in dealing with all administrative aspects of the life cycle of a property investment from purchase to sale

financial advice

retirement planning
one of the biggest areas of concern our clients talk to us about is planning for the day they will eventually retire. pensions can be a great cause of uncertainty, with large sums of money held in multiple pots through changes of employment over people’s lifetime. our aim is to help relieve this uncertainty to ensure that, once your working life is over and you start a new chapter, you will be financially comfortable and able to do all the things you hope to do.

personal & business protection
when it comes to asset protection advice, our aim is to help you reach your financial goals at the same time as creating protection in case something unexpected happens, whether that’s illness or death. this protection is an important way to ensure your family will be looked after in this situation.

estate planning
there is huge peace of mind in knowing that, one day when you’re not here any more, your family and loved ones will be able to get the biggest benefit possible from your inheritance wishes. our aim in offering inheritance tax planning is making sure you – and your family – are fully aware of what happens to your investments in event of your death, and to make sure your protection is structured in the most tax efficient way.

what is a chartered financial planner?
chartered financial planners are a type of independent financial advisor (or ifa for short). ifas are so called because they are not tied to financial products from a particular provider; instead they are 'independent' and can advise on and recommend financial products from the entire market.
here in the uk, ifas are strictly regulated by the financial conduct authority (fca). in practice this means that an ifa is a qualified professional who:
(a) has passed examinations set by the chartered insurance institute (cii), and
(b) is obligated to keep their financial knowledge up to date and in line with the current best practice indefinitely, in a process called continuing professional development or cpd.
less than 5% of fca regulated ifa firms in the city of london have achieved the professional standard of chartered financial planners. here's why:
first, individual plannners must have at least five years' relevant experience in the industry, as well as no less than three years' cpd.
then, they must complete the cii’s advanced diploma in financial planning. this qualification, one of most demanding in the industry, aims to ensure that the ifa's knowledge, ability, ethics and conduct are all without question and meet the cii's extremely rigorous standards.
last, chartered financial planners must always hold valid membership of the personal finance society, an achievement in its own right.
ed's areas of expertise and financial qualifications.
what is a certified financial planner?
a cfp can be seen as a personal trainer for your finances. just like a trainer in a gym asks you to sets goals, keeps a record and assesses how your fitness plan is progressing, a cfp will perform a similar role for your money. you can expect a qualified cfp to do the following:
work out what you are hoping to achieve from your finances e.g. buy a house, start a business or plan a dream retirement.
understand what resources you have currently to meet your objectives e.g. existing income and capital.
create a realistic plan to meet your objectives using some given assumptions e.g. tax, inflation, and growth.
test, adjust and reshape the plan as your circumstances change.
the term certified financial planner or cfp is applied to a financial adviser who has successfully completed and attained the award of cfpcm as dictated by the institute of financial planning (ifp).
the cfp qualification is the only internationally recognized professional financial planning qualification in existence. there are over 900 cfp advisers in the uk and 139,000 worldwide. look for the following charter mark to make sure the firm you deal with include experienced advisers that have attained this valuable qualification.
nick's areas of expertise and financial qualifications.
the fca aims to make identifying a financial advisor that you can trust to provide unbiased, independent advice as easy as possible. the additional qualifications that ed holder and nick combes have achieved, and the firm's resulting chartered status, mean that our financial advice and planning are not only independent and professional, but in the top flight.

what our clients are saying about interestme
before speaking to ross, i knew very little about my pension and certainly didn’t view it as a pot of money i could invest and earn interest on. now i feel i can look forward to retirement secure in the knowledge i’ll have a good pension waiting for me.
choosing what type of isa to invest in and with which company was quite confusing. i wanted to earn better returns than a standard cash isa would pay and after speaking to interestme i felt confident that investing in one of their risk rated portfolios will achieve my goals.
they explained everything in a very straight-forward, jargon-free way. i’d defnitely recommend interestme to anyone as the service i’ve received has been excellent.

​
​
step 1 - the first legal step is to serve a section 21 notice which gives the tenant 2 months notice or a section 8 notice (2 weeks - where there are rent arrears or other grounds for eviction i.e. breach of tenancy). by initiating this first step you are on your way to gaining possession of your property. certain conditions need to be met to serve a valid section 21, and if they have not then we can advise on appropriate solutions to remedy any problems. the notices need to be carefully drafted in order for the process to succeed. if they are not then you will lose valuable time and money.
step 2 - if your tenant doesn't leave after the notice period has expired, then we commence proceedings in the county court to acquire possession of your property and to recover any rent arrears if applicable.. there are three procedures depending on your case. 1 - accelerated - if all conditions are met then you will acquire mandatory possession 2 - standard (s21) - where a court hearing will be required. this is when the accelerated procedure conditions are not met. 3 - standard (section 8) usually rent arrears, but can be any other breach of tenancy.
step 3 - the final step, if your tenant doesn't leave after a possession order date is set, is to enforce the possession order through a county or high court bailiff. the process of using county court bailiffs can be frustrating due to the timescales involved. we can instruct bailiffs and make the process seamless and quicker for you using high court bailiffs. when your tenant has been removed we can also assist in arrears recovery matters. finally, if you you are intending of re-letting we can provide you with a fully tailored professional landlord service for peace of mind.

find out more about our range of insurance products for market traders below…
public liability insurance
as market traders operate in a physical environment with high footfall, public liability insurance can provide peace of mind and protect your business if someone suffers an injury or property damage as a result of your market stall.
van and truck insurance
we can arrange van and truck insurance exclusively for market traders and stallholders at events, exhibitions and festivals.
cover can be arranged for panel vans, box vans, trucks, mobile shops and catering vehicles.
stock insurance
in case something happens to the products or materials you keep in stock, we can arrange stock insurance cover at your home or in storage, at the market or in your vehicle.
we offer £2,500 of cover for your market stall, fixtures, fittings and general contents automatically, although the cover level can be increased if required. £75,000 cover for business interruption is also included, as is cover for loss of money and personal assault.
household insurance
we can also arrange household insurance for market traders, with cover for up to £1,000,000 new for old available which can be extended to include accidental damage.
car insurance
we can also arrange car insurance for market traders, which can include cover for business use and carriage of own goods.
other market trader insurance products
as well as the above range of insurance products for market traders, we can also arrange employers’ liability and product liability cover.
employers’ liability insurance is a legal requirement if you employ workers on your market stall and provides cover in case an employee is injured or falls ill as a result of working on your stall.
product liability insurance covers compensation payments and legal costs should a product that you sell cause injury or property damage to a third party. this includes cover for food poisoning resulting from any food and drink products you have produced or prepared.
to find out more about all of the insurance products we provide for market traders, contact the team at marketline today for your own personalised quote.

innovative finance isas can compare favourably to other forms of isa investment, this is not the same as cash isa investing. capital at risk and returns are not guaranteed. maven bonds are not readily realisable and are not covered by the financial services compensation scheme (fscs). you will need to choose which bonds to hold in your ifisa - returns can be earned tax free. tax treatment depends on the individual circumstances of each investor.
what are fixed term bonds?
there are number of different types of fixed term bonds and its important to understand the differences. a fixed term bonds can be a savings bond, an investment bond or a mini bond.
fixed term savings bonds generally offer fixed rates of between 1.5% per annum and 2.0% per annum. some can be held within a cash isa, so the returns are tax free.
fixed term investment bonds mainly fall into two categories, onshore and offshore. the main difference is their tax treatment. onshore are subject to uk corporation tax, while offshore bonds are issued from outside the uk and the returns roll up gross of tax in the funds.
fixed term mini bonds are a form of debt that allows investors to invest in a company or property project and receive a fixed return over a set period of time, with the initial investment returned at the end of the fixed term.
certain mini bonds such as maven bonds are ifisa elibigle and also offer tax free returns.
fixed term ifisa bonds
the innovative finance isa (ifisa) - introduced to the isa family in april 2016 - is an isa account that allows you to hold peer-to-peer (p2p) loans and fixed term bonds and enjoy tax free returns.
there is a limit on the amount you can subscribe to isas each tax year, known as the annual isa allowance - currently £20,000 for the tax year 2019/20. this allowance can be fully invested in an innovative finance isa, or spread across the different types of isa, including cash isas, stocks and shares isas or a lifetime isa.
to be eligible to open an ifisa, you must be a uk resident aged 18 or over.

testimonials
as first time market investors, we were cautious in our expectations. however, our income and growth targets have been exceeded. dr james ingram, our adviser, is thorough in his stock selection, monitors the portfolio, keeps us informed and warns us of any dangers. an excellent level of service.
mr v roberts of north wales (march 2018)
when looking for a private client broker, i wanted someone who could offer me professional advice, be prepared to look outside of the typical stocks, and communicate in such a way that their reasoning always made sense and ensured that my portfolio maintained a steady growth. james has offered me all these things, and importantly this means that there is a level of trust such that i would recommend him to friends and family.
john r. of london (april 2018)
when i joined mb capital as a client i wanted a share portfolio in a range of industries that would deliver some growth and some income. my conversation with mbc helped me find a range of interesting stocks from tech to retail. i am also impressed with the level of client contact. regular telephone contact helps me make buy or sell decisions that so far have proved to be profitable ones. ideal.
trevor i. of bedfordshire (june 2018)
mb capital have been looking after my portfolio for about 3 years and dr james ingram has been my dedicated point of contact for about a year. james is very pleasant to deal with and more particularly is extremely professional in his approach. we speak several times a month and he is always looking out and checking the progress on my stocks and phones me to discuss any opportunities to both buy and sell. i would have no hesitation in recommending his services.
mr. s. hallett - north scotland
now in my eighties i have invested such funds as i had accumulated in various savings within my bank. earlier this year i was complaining to a personal friend about the poor returns i was receiving. it seemed that the benefit was in the main to the advantage of the bank and the returns to the customer were minimal. my friend recommended that i try mb capital. this was some of the best advice i have received for many years. dr james ingram of mb capital has worked wonders in putting forward suggestions for a basic portfolio and subsequent changes that have been financially rewarding. i am a simpleton on the financial market's whys and wherefores. james has been leading me by the hand through the mystiques of the exchange in a courteous and friendly fashion.<br /> not only has his advice been to my capital gain but i have enjoyed immensely the process of increasing my capital and 'pocket money'. i look forward to james's telephone calls and subsequent emails with a degree of excitement. thank you james: thank you mb capital.
mr. p. holbourn, north wales

environmental, social and governance (esg)
whilst 'sustainability' is a term now used when addressing some of the planet's most pressing issues, it's the emergence of esg in the financial markets which will drive future investment for years to come.
we support our clients to improve transparency, keeping up to speed with industry developments and, where relevant, aligning disclosure which enables debt to be structurally linked to esg, either through the underlying purpose of the funding or a broader corporate key performance indicator.

nextwealth directory
from financial planning tools to back office, we list the providers and tell you what your peers think of them.
read a review. leave a review.
the nextwealth directory rates and reviews the technology that supports financial planning businesses, including the main platforms and back office providers. the nextwealth directory is for business owners, financial planners, paraplanners and support and ops staff looking for realistic views on what works, and in particular, what pieces of technology can integrate together.
click on a product area below to compare current providers and to read reviews from your peers. please also leave a review of any providers you work with.
practice management system
practice management systems are often the backbone of a financial planning firm’s technology infrastructure, but they are also a huge source of frustration. here we profile the main players, provide user reviews and detail integrations.
view providers
cashflow modelling
cashflow modelling has become an integral part of a holistic financial planning service for many firms and supports specific advice processes for others. compare reviews, features and integrations here.
view providers
client portal
“marmite” of advice technology; an essential part of an up-to-date digital offering for some firms and a distraction and non-starter for others. if a client portal is right for your proposition, review features and integration options here.
view providers
platform
price often drives platform choice but poor service is the top reason advisers move assets off of a platform. our directory helps you get the truth about platform service levels, before you put a customer’s money on the platform. we give our view on the relative merits of each platform and share user reviews.
view providers
suitability profiling
suitability profiling has evolved into an integrated part of the advice toolkit for most firms, as well as coming under significant regulatory scrutiny in recent years. advisers need to be comfortable with the methodology and language as well as integration options.
view providers
cash management
cash management tools have become a newer addition to the advice process. if a cash management tool is right for you review features and integrations here.

other
some tools simply don’t fit in a wider bracket, yet provide much valued services to the advice process. you can explore these tools in further detail including integrations available and user reviews.

welcome to penn accounts
your specialist accountants serving small to mid sized businesses: taking away the headache so that you can concentrate on your business.
the financial affairs of an individual taxpayer and companies alike are becoming more and more complex, confusing and unnecessarily burdensome. getting it wrong now invariably means there are penalties, surcharges and interest to pay. who wants to pay punitive tax penalties?
﻿
conversely, failure to effectively manage your own or your companies tax affairs can often lead to a potential overpayment of tax that can have a significant effect on cash flow and the business generally.
﻿
all accountants are not the same. some treat you like the number, which is ironic under the circumstances.
at penn accounts, we are different. we are not a burgeoning accountancy practice. we do not have banks of assistants who undertake the majority of the work - for us it is personal.
​
we help you from where you are now as a business, to where you want to go. together.

case study
c2 industrials llp and stenprop
the brief
c2 industrials llp partnered with an institutional investor to form an industrials limited partnership (“lp”), which planned to invest in multi-let industrial properties across the uk.
the industrials lp commenced in january 2015 and over the next 30 months invested over £100m, acquiring 25 multi-let industrial estates throughout the uk. those properties were managed by three agents with different reporting systems and output. harold sharp managed the entire financial operations from day-to-day cash management through to operational and statutory reporting to the management team and investors.
as an institutionally backed investment, c2 industrials was required to produce management accounts within 5 days of each month-end and comply with the reporting requirements of a multinational investor.
the solution
harold sharp managed the industrials lp on a cloud-based platform utilising bank feeds and brought in agents’ records, supplier invoices and expenses via an api enabled application, delivering an integrated solution, which could be managed and accessed remotely.
the outcome
harold sharp designed and delivered a scalable cloud-based solution providing real-time information for a multinational investor with a geographically diverse portfolio managed by multiple property agents.
in june 2017, the industrials uk lp was sold to stenprop. harold sharp acted as advisors to c2 industrials llp and its institutional partner on this transaction, managing the financial due diligence process, advising on the contract and preparing the associated completion accounts.
following the acquisition of industrials portfolio, harold sharp was retained by stenprop to manage the entire financial operations of stenprop’s mli division – now a portfolio of 60 industrial estates valued at £255m. due to the massive scale of the new operation, stenprop decided to take the accounting in-house. the cloud-based integrated systems used by harold sharp were easily portable, meaning that the in-housing was very simple.
harold sharp managed the day-to-day financial operations of a fast growing multi-let industrial (mli) investment business.

the most successful investors take financial advice. we will cut through the complexities and use the benefit of our experience to help you achieve your financial goals.
benefits of advice
don’t take our word for it. here is what some of our customers say:
cp, property developer
it was amazing really, i had not considered that my pension could be so flexible. my adviser was really excellent. he came up with the ideas and took care of everything to make it happen. i am very impressed with the attention to detail he showed and the overall service. it took no time at all and he was and is always on hand to help with anything i need. you never know what changes are around the corner, but i feel well placed with my pension.
mc, airline employee
my adviser was simply brill! he got to know me and my situation, carried out lots of work without charging any fees and really took the time to help me understand everything. i’m so glad to have got my pension underway with the help of my adviser and i am genuinely looking forward to our forthcoming review meetings.
ftadviser’s top 100 financial advisers
we’re delighted to announce that quilter financial planning, of which we’re a part, has achieved first place in the ftadviser’s annual top 100 financial advisers list for a second year running.
company of the year

it’s good to keep up to date with what’s going on in the financial market, especially in these uncertain times.

stop and think: stay safe from scams
there has been a rise in fraudsters who are impersonating quilter and other financial services providers. they often use techniques such as creating bogus websites, sending ‘cloned’ emails that pretend to be from a real firm, and most recently we have identified fraudsters attempting to convince clients that a bone fide business has changed its bank account details to encourage funds to be paid into the fraudster’s own account.
to become scam smart and reduce the risk of fraud we urge you to review our guidance on how to keep your finances safe by visiting our dedicated stay safe page, which includes a scam reporting form if you believe you have been targeted.

ftadviser’s annual top 100 financial advisers list
we're delighted to announce that quilter financial planning has achieved first place in the ftadviser’s annual top 100 financial advisers list for the second year running.
we're very proud of winning this award, which recognises not only the growth of our network and national businesses over the past year, but also our continued commitment to providing quality face-to-face advice.
company of the year
quilter was also awarded ‘company of the year’ at the ft financial adviser service awards 2020.
the financial adviser service awards, now in their 30th year, are much sought-after within the financial services industry. they are voted on by advisers with the aim of highlighting the very best in service provision.
open for business
we want to reassure you that we are committed to providing the best possible service to you during these unsettling times. we are working hard to ensure that you can continue to interact with us, whilst also ensuring the wellbeing of our colleagues. each member of our teams are fully equipped and operational to work remotely for the foreseeable future.
our plans include keeping a watchful eye on the latest government announcements, to ensure we can quickly react as additional measures to halt the spread of the virus are introduced. we have taken steps to ensure we can continue to support your needs during covid and beyond, including:
enabling colleagues to work from remote locations as necessary, using our secure and tested technology
making greater use of video conferencing tools to keep in contact with clients, colleagues and advisers
restrictions on business travel
office phone lines and post are being diverted so you can still get in touch
supporting colleagues to remain resilient through periods of altered working practices
we will continue to adapt to the needs of our colleagues and you, our much valued clients and hope to return to normal working practices as soon as it is safe to do so.
if you have any questions or concerns regarding your investments please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
you can visit our dedicated coronavirus page here for more information.
stop and think: stay safe from scams
there has been a rise in fraudsters who are impersonating quilter and other financial services providers. they often use techniques such as creating bogus websites, sending ‘cloned’ emails that pretend to be from a real firm, and most recently we have identified fraudsters attempting to convince clients that a bone fide business has changed its bank account details to encourage funds to be paid into the fraudster’s own account.
to become scam smart and reduce the risk of fraud we urge you to review our guidance on how to keep your finances safe by visiting our dedicated stay safe page, which includes a scam reporting form if you believe you have been targeted.

us tax return preparation
the tax return preparation for us expats can be more complex than a ‘domestic; tax return, which often require additional ‘foreign’ forms to be completed. many us based cpas are unable to prepare these forms effectively. as part of our core compliance service we can prepare federal, state and local tax returns. we can also prepare form 1040-nr for individuals who are us non-residents and are required to file us tax returns.
us itin services
whether you need to apply for a new us individual tax identification number (itin), or if you need assistance in renewing your itin, we can help. we are irs certified acceptance agents for itin applications.
foreign bank account reporting (fbar)
us citizens and green card holders are required to file the fbar (form fincen 114) if they have non-us accounts and certain thresholds are exceeded. it is a separate form to your tax returns and the requirement to file should be reviewed annually. we can produce the forms and assist in the annual review.
late filing of returns
many americans are not aware that they continue to have a us tax return filing requirement even if they do not live in the us, and as such it may be that they have not filed us tax returns for many years. the irs provides a systems for such people to ‘catch up’ with their tax filings with reduced filing obligations. if this applies to you feel free to contact us to discuss further.
irs notices and audits
as irs enrolled agents, we are able to liaise with the irs on your behalf. so you can rest assured that we can take care of irs notices you receive, or have received, and handle any audits that may arise.
tax planning
the uk is considered to be a ‘high tax’ country and americans living in the uk often end up paying more in taxes than they would have if they earned the same income in the us. however, there are various reliefs and exemptions available (both in the us and the uk) that can help to reduce the impact. careful planning is required to ensure americans minimise their overall tax obligations.
review of prior returns
if you believe there may be errors with previous tax filings, or if you want us to review the tax efficiency of those returns, please contact us and we can help.
estimates & projections
with the reliefs and exemptions available to americans living in the uk it can become difficult to calculate tax liabilities and keep on to up the payments you need to make to the irs and hmrc. we can help with the necessary estimates and help you to manage the process.
uk self assessment preparation
in many cases, americans living in the uk will not need to filed tax returns in the uk. however, you may need to if you are claiming certain reliefs of have income from certain sources. should you need uk tax returns prepared alongside your us returns we can assist. often it is best that both your us and uk returns are prepared by the same preparer to ensure information is reported accurately, efficiently and consistently in both jurisdictions.
uk non dom advice
the uk tax rules for americans and green card holders who are resident in the uk but not uk domiciled can be very beneficial. the practicalities of achieving these benefits can be quite involved and often requires that certain process are followed prior to transactions taking place. we can help you manage the processes and provide assistance in making the most tax effective decisions.

welcome to tomorrow loans
tomorrow loans is a company led by a team of experienced professionals offering a cost effective inheritance tax solution.
inheritance tax (iht), once the problem of only the very wealthy, now captures many more people, often those who have worked hard and saved all their lives. iht is charged on the transfer of value to others. it is a tax most of us come across when someone dies and passes on their assets on death.
inheritance tax is currently charged at 40% for assets above iht threshold of £325,000 (also known as nil rate band) for single person and £650,000 threshold for a married couple or civil partnership. the recent introduction of the main residence nil-rate band means that in 2019/20, an additional £150,000 of the value of the main residence may be passed on to direct descendants iht free. the nil rate band has failed to keep pace with inflation and is expected to remain at the same level until 2021. more and more estates are likely to be charged iht.
inheritance tax liability can be reduced or potentially eliminated with some simple and careful planning.
tomorrow loans offers a simple, cost effective solution for reducing the tax liability on assets passed after your death, enabling you to make business relief (br) qualifying investments. business relief, previously know as business property relief, is a tax relief introduced as a part of the 1976 finance act. initially aimed at reducing the tax liability paid by small business passed on to future generations, today br is an efficient way of reducing iht liability by owning shares in a br-qualifying business. shares owned for at least two years at the time of death can be passed to your loved ones free from inheritance tax.

good habits pay off in the long term. take the first steps toward providing for your future security by building a plan, starting with saving towards your first home and ensuring that your employer's pension provision is effectively invested. if you start saving early towards your deposit, school fees and retirement your growth multiplies over time.

having set out your key objectives, we provide constant assessment of risk to ensure you achieve your plan. we can consolidate your various workplace pensions to put you in greater control, actively managing them to take advantage of rising markets and positioning against volatility - all the while navigating the jargon and optimising your tax arrangements.
protect
these days retirement tends to be a process rather than an event, and when you're no longer willing or able to work full time the security of your income is paramount. investment strategy is the key to ensuring you carry on living the life you want; while at the same time we must also be up to date with your position regarding care funding and inheritance tax to protect the real value of your estate's assets.
